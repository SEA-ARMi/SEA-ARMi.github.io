VIETNAM INVESTIGATOR – Dr. PHAN MY HANH

Dr. Phan My Hanh received her specialist degree from Moscow State University of Applied Biotechnology (now known as Russian Biotechnological University - ROSBIOTECH) and subsequently obtained her PhD from Lomonosov Moscow State University in the field of biotechnology (including nanobiotechnology). Currently, Dr. Hạnh serves as the Head of the Microbiology Technology Department at the Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. She describes herself as a person with her head in the clouds who often wanders in forests or cafés rather than staying at home.

After returning to Vietnam, Dr. Hanh and her colleagues began building a collection of microorganisms to serve organic agriculture and developing tailored microbial consortia for farms, aiming toward precision organic agriculture. She is interested in agrigenomics, metagenomics, NGS, WGS, and other related molecular biology techniques.

The more projects they implement in practice, the more Dr. Hanh and her colleagues recognize the increasingly serious impact of fungal diseases and the effects of antifungal resistance on crops, livestock, and humans. Therefore, she calls on her colleagues (MSc. Le Thi Thuy Nhi, MSc. Nguyen Thi Hong Chuyen, MSc. Doan Thi Kim Ngan) to join the SEA-ARMi project to provide even more support together.
