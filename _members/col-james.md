MALAYSIA INVESTIGATOR – JASPER ELVIN JAMES, Ph.D., M.Sc., BB.Med.Sc.

Dr. Jasper James is a Molecular Mycologist with a research focus on the mechanisms of antifungal resistance. He is currently a senior lecturer at the Faculty of Science and Technology, National University of Malaysia (UKM). Prior to joining UKM, Dr. James completed two years of postdoctoral training at the Department of Mycology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria. He earned his PhD at UKM’s Faculty of Health Sciences, with his research conducted primarily at the Sir John Walsh Research Institute, University of Otago, New Zealand. He was trained by Associate Professor Dr. Jacinta Santhanam, Dr. Erwin Lamping, and Professor Richard Cannon. <br>
His research focuses on azole resistance in filamentous fungi, including Aspergillus, Fusarium, Sporothrix species, and the Mucorales, with an emphasis on genetic mutations and drug efflux pumps. He is also interested in investigating fungal pathogen-host interactions. As an educator, Dr. James believes that using real-world examples and emphasizing the interconnectedness of ecological systems are key to motivating students.
