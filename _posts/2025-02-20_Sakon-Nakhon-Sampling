A research team led by Dr. Ratmanee Chanabun from Thailand has conducted a fungal sampling study in Sakon Nakhon, focusing on key agricultural areas. <br>
The sampling sites were selected based on the WHO FPPL distribution map, covering Kut Bak, Song Dao, and Ban Mueang. Researchers collected samples from various plant fields, including rubber tree plantations, cassava fields, and sugarcane farms. <br>
In addition to fungal collection, soil parameters such as water content, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and pH were analyzed in the laboratory to understand their influence on fungal diversity. The identification of fungal species will be conducted using ITS metaamplicon sequencing alongside culture-based approaches. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of fungal biodiversity and its ecological significance in agricultural environments.
