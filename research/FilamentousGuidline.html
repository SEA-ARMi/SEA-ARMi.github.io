The list categorizes pathogens into three priority levels: critical, high, and medium, focusing on key strategies such as strengthening laboratory capacity, ensuring sustained investment in R&amp;D, and improving public health policies to prevent resistance (Figure 1). \n\n{%\n  include figure.html\n  image=\"images/content/F1-list.PNG\"\n  caption=\"Figure 1. WHO Fungal Pathogen Priority List. World Health Otganization, 2022\"\n  width=\"750px\"\n%}\n\nIn Thailand, fungal pathogens like _Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans,_ and _Talaromyces marneffei_ have been reported in hospitals, with non-albicans Candida species like Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata also prevalent. Despite the presence of certain pathogens in clinical settings, many others, such as _Acremonium_ spp., _Fusarium_ spp., and _Mucor_ spp., remain under-monitored.\nThe lack of comprehensive environmental surveys in Southeast Asia complicates the understanding of fungal pathogen reservoirs, especially in tropical habitats. The GlobalFungi database shows limited surveys in Thailand, highlighting the need for focused environmental studies. Moreover, there is a general absence of WHO FPPL data across the region, pointing to significant gaps in fungal pathogen monitoring (Table 1).\n\n{%\n  include figure.html\n  image=\"images/content/F2-asean.PNG\"\n  caption=\"Table 1. Red box, the urgency of WHO FPPL in Southeast Asia. Casalini, Giacomelli, &amp; Antinori, 2024\"\n  width=\"750px\"\n%}\n\n## Filamentous WHO-FPPL\nFilamentous fungi are a group of fungi characterized by the presence of long, thread-like structures called hyphae. These hyphae grow in a branching, network-like formation called a mycelium, which is the vegetative part of the fungus. Filamentous fungi are responsible for a wide range of environmental processes, including decomposition, and can also cause various infections in humans, especially in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n### Key Characteristics:\n* Hyphal Structure: Hyphae are long, thin filaments that spread across surfaces and grow by extending at their tips.\n* Mycelium: A mass of hyphae forms the mycelium, which can infiltrate substrates, allowing the fungus to absorb nutrients.\n* Reproduction: These fungi can reproduce both sexually and asexually, with spore production being common, which allows them to spread and colonize new environments.\nCommon examples of filamentous fungi include species from genera such as _Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium,_ and _Mucor_, which can have significant medical, environmental, and industrial relevance.\nThese fungi can thrive in various environments, including soil, decaying organic matter, and indoor spaces, where they may pose health risks when inhaled, particularly to those with weakened immune systems.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\nCommon examples of filamentous fungi include species from genera such as _Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium,_ and _Mucor_, which can have significant medical, environmental, and industrial relevance.\nThese fungi can thrive in various environments, including soil, decaying organic matter, and indoor spaces, where they may pose health risks when inhaled, particularly to those with weakened immune systems.\nFor this FAILSAFE Project, our target is Eumycetoma causative agents, _Fusarium_ group, and Mucorales order.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n### Eumycetoma causative agents\nGroup of fungi makes a serious tissue infection caused by fungi from soil and water, entering the body through skin breaks. Fungal agents include _Madurella_ spp., _Acremonium_ spp., _Curvularia lunata_, _Falciformispora senegalensis_, _Fusarium_ spp., _Scedosporium_ spp., _Zopfia rosatii_, and others, though data is limited. It primarily affects impoverished individuals, causing significant life disruption and leading to amputation in some cases. High-risk groups are young male farmers, with amputation rates reaching up to 39% (Figure 2).\n\n{%\n  include figure.html\n  image=\"images/content/F3-mycetoma.PNG\"\n  caption=\"Figure 2. Eumycetoma update. Sande &amp; Fahal, 2024\"\n  width=\"850px\"\n%}\n\n### _Fusarium_ group\n_Fusarium_ spp. are molds found mainly in tropical regions, though they are globally distributed in soil and decomposing organic material. They can cause invasive infections, particularly in the respiratory system and eyes, and can spread to other organs, including the central nervous system. These fungi are also capable of causing fungaemia due to their ability to release spores into the bloodstream.\n&lt;br&gt;\n### Mucorales order\nGroup of pathogenic molds, including _Rhizopus_ spp., _Mucor_ spp., and _Lichthiemia_ spp., that can cause mucormycosis when their spores are inhaled. These molds primarily affect the lungs and sinuses but can also spread to the eyes, brain, and gastrointestinal tract. Infection can also occur through skin wounds, especially after trauma or burns. Mucormycosis does not spread between individuals. It is most common in immunocompromised patients, such as those with cancer, diabetes, or trauma injuries. The disease has a high mortality rate, ranging from 23% to 80% in adults, and up to 72.7% in children. Risk factors include neutropenia, diabetes, and trauma.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nReferences:\n* [World Health Organization. 2022.

<p>Filamentous fungi are a group of fungi characterized by the presence of long, thread-like structures called hyphae. These hyphae grow in a branching, network-like formation called a mycelium, which is the vegetative part of the fungus. Filamentous fungi are responsible for a wide range of environmental processes, including decomposition, and can also cause various infections in humans, especially in immunocompromised individuals.</p>
