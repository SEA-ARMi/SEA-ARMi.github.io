# SLIDE CULTURE TECHNIQUE
The slide culture technique is a laboratory method used for the identification of fungi, especially those that produce characteristic structures such as spores and hyphae. This technique allows fungi to grow in a controlled environment while preserving their natural morphology, which is crucial for accurate identification under a microscope based on the structure. <br>
<br>
Fungal structures examined under the microscope include *hyphae* (filamentous structures that form the mycelium), which can be *septate* (divided by cross-walls) or *aseptate* (continuous without septa).<br> 
Reproductive structures such as spores are also key identifiers. These include *asexual spores* (e.g., conidia and sporangiospores) and *sexual spores* (e.g., ascospores, basidiospores). Specialized structures like *conidiophores* (which bear conidia), *sporangia* (sacs containing sporangiospores), and *fruiting bodies* (multicellular reproductive structures) provide additional diagnostic details. <br>
Other structures of interest include *chlamydospores* (thick-walled survival spores), *arthrospores* (formed by hyphal fragmentation), and *yeast cells* (unicellular fungi reproducing by budding). *Pseudohyphae* (chains of yeast cells resembling true hyphae), along with *rhizoids* (root-like structures) and *stolons* (horizontal connecting hyphae), are also examined. <br>
This technique often employs staining methods like lactophenol cotton blue, calcofluor white, or KOH mounts to enhance visibility and detail of these fungal structures, aiding accurate identification. 
## Procedure
This procedure adapted from Senanayake et al., 2024.
### 1. Equipments
Everything should be sterilized:<br>
1. Ose needle<br>
2. Petri dish (disposable)<br>
3. Slide and cover glass<br>
4. Spatula or scalpel<br>
5. V-shape glass or metal rod<br>
6. Water<br>
7. Pipette or Micropipette (sterilized the tip for micropipette)<br>
8. Forceps<br>
9. Ethanol in the glass jar<br>
10. Potato dextrose agar medium added by antibacterial and poured into the Petri dish<br>
### 2. Processes
The slide culture preparation must be done in Biosafety Cabinet (BSC).<br>
Step 1: Prepare all equipment in the BSC and put the forceps and spatula or scalpel into the ethanol in the jar.<br>
Step 2: Put the V-shape glass rod to the Petri dish.<br>
Step 3: Add the sterile water 500 uL to the Petri dish.<br>
Step 4: Put the slide glass to the V-shape glass rod, please put it carefully and avoid too many movements for making the slide glass keep on the position. (Figure 1)
