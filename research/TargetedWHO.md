# TARGETED FILAMENTOUS WHO-FPPL
There are three targeted filamentous WHO-FPPL that we concern, which are **_Fusarium_ spp.**, **Eumycetoma causative agents**, and **Mucorales**. In this illustration, we used the isolate from collection culture the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University. <br> 
For preparing this identification, we used the [Slide Culture Technique.](https://sea-armi.github.io/research/SlideCulture) Please check on the linked page.
### _Fusarium_ spp.
Here is the genera included in _Fusarium_ spp. that we have in Nat Pombubpa Lab:
**1. _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. lycopersici DOAC 0874 – MSCU 0232** on PDA medium (**Figure 1**).<br>
_Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. lycopersici is a filamentous fungal pathogen responsible for Fusarium wilt in tomato plants (_Solanum lycopersicum_), causing significant global crop losses. It invades the plant's vascular system, leading to wilting and is known for its resilience and persistence in soil.

#### Characteristics
**Morphology**: Produces violet to white colonies on most media; lacks pigment on King’s B medium.<br>
**On PDA**: Forms dense, cottony or woolly mycelia. Colony color transitions from white to violet or light purple with age. The reverse side shows reddish or purplish pigmentation.<br>
**Growth**: Rapid growth at 25–30°C, often covering plates within days.<br>
**Spore Production**: Produces macroconidia (sickle-shaped, multiseptate), microconidia (oval or ellipsoid, single- or two-celled), and sometimes chlamydospores.

#### Classification
**Kingdom**: Fungi<br>
**Phylum**: Ascomycota<br>
**Class**: Sordariomycetes<br>
**Order**: Hypocreales<br>
**Family**: Nectriaceae<br>
**Genus**: _Fusarium_<br>
**Species**: _Fusarium oxysporum_<br>
**Forma Specialis**: lycopersici<br>

### Mucorales
The target genera included in the Mucorales order are:<br>
_Rhizopus_ spp.<br>
_Mucor_ spp.<br>
_Lichtheimia_ spp.<br>
_Rhizomucor_ spp.<br>
_Cunninghamella_ spp.<br>
_Syncephalastrum_ spp.<br>
_Apophysomyces_ spp<br>
<br>
Here are examples of Mucorales representatives that we have in Nat Pombubpa Lab:
**3. _Mucor rouxii_(+) – MSCU0009** on PDA medium (**Figure 3**). <br>
_Mucor rouxii_ is a filamentous fungus belonging to the Mucorales order, commonly found in soil and decaying organic matter. It is known for its dimorphic nature, exhibiting both filamentous and yeast-like growth forms depending on environmental conditions. While primarily saprophytic, _Mucor rouxii_ can act as an opportunistic pathogen, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, causing infections such as mucormycosis.

#### Characteristics
**Morphology**: On solid media, Mucor rouxii forms fast-growing, cottony colonies that are initially white and may turn grayish or brownish with age. In liquid media or anaerobic conditions, it can display yeast-like growth.<br>
**On PDA**: Produces dense, fluffy colonies that grow rapidly, typically filling the plate within a few days under optimal conditions (25–30°C).<br>
**Spore Production**: Produces sporangia containing sporangiospores, which are smooth-walled and spherical to ellipsoidal. Sporangia are borne on long sporangiophores with a characteristic columella at the base.<br>
**Growth Conditions**: Prefers temperatures between 25–30°C and thrives in nutrient-rich environments.

#### Classification
**Kingdom**: Fungi<br>
**Phylum**: Zygomycota<br>
**Class**: Zygomycetes<br>
**Order**: Mucorales<br>
**Family**: Mucoraceae<br>
**Genus**: _Mucor_<br>
**Species**: _Mucor rouxii_<br>

**4. _Rhizopus_ sp. – MSCU0015** on PDA medium (**Figure 4**). <br>
_Rhizopus_ species are filamentous fungi belonging to the Mucorales order, widely distributed in soil, decaying organic material, and various foods. These fungi are known for their saprophytic lifestyle and rapid growth, making them significant decomposers. However, some species, such as _Rhizopus oryzae_ and _Rhizopus arrhizus_, are opportunistic pathogens, causing mucormycosis in immunocompromised individuals.

#### Characteristics
**Morphology**: Rapidly growing colonies with a cottony or fluffy texture, typically white at first, turning grayish to black as sporangia mature. The reverse of the plate may show a pale to dark coloration, depending on the medium.<br>
**On PDA**: Forms dense, fast-spreading colonies that can cover the plate within 24–48 hours under optimal conditions.<br>
**Spore Production**: Produces sporangia at the tips of sporangiophores, which are long, unbranched, and terminate in round, dark sporangia containing sporangiospores. Rhizoids (root-like structures) are present at the base of the sporangiophores, a distinguishing feature.<br>
**Growth Conditions**: Thrives at 25–37°C, with rapid growth in high humidity and nutrient-rich environments.<br>
**Pathogenicity**: Causes mucormycosis, particularly rhinocerebral, pulmonary, and cutaneous infections, primarily in individuals with diabetes, neutropenia, or trauma.

#### Classification
**Kingdom**: Fungi<br>
**Phylum**: Zygomycota<br>
**Class**: Zygomycetes<br>
**Order**: Mucorales<br>
**Family**: Mucoraceae<br>
**Genus**: _Rhizopus_<br>
