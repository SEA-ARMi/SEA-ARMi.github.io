# TARGETED FILAMENTOUS WHO-FPPL
There are three targeted filamentous WHO-FPPL that we concern, which are **_Fusarium_**, **Eumycetoma causative agents**, and **Mucorales**. In this illustration, we used the isolate from collection culture the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University. <br> 
For preparing this identification, we used the [Slide Culture Technique.](https://sea-armi.github.io/research/SlideCulture) Please check on the linked page.
### _Fusarium_
**1.** _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. lycopersici DOAC 0874 – MSCU 0232 on PDA medium (**Figure 1**).<br>
_Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. lycopersici is a filamentous fungal pathogen responsible for Fusarium wilt in tomato plants (_Solanum lycopersicum_), causing significant global crop losses. It invades the plant's vascular system, leading to wilting and is known for its resilience and persistence in soil.

#### Characteristics
**Morphology**: Produces violet to white colonies on most media; lacks pigment on King’s B medium.<br>
**On PDA**: Forms dense, cottony or woolly mycelia. Colony color transitions from white to violet or light purple with age. The reverse side shows reddish or purplish pigmentation.<br>
**Growth**: Rapid growth at 25–30°C, often covering plates within days.<br>
**Spore Production**: Produces macroconidia (sickle-shaped, multiseptate), microconidia (oval or ellipsoid, single- or two-celled), and sometimes chlamydospores.

#### Classification
**Kingdom**: Fungi<br>
**Phylum**: Ascomycota<br>
**Class**: Sordariomycetes<br>
**Order**: Hypocreales<br>
**Family**: Nectriaceae<br>
**Genus**: _Fusarium_<br>
**Species**: _Fusarium oxysporum_<br>
**Forma Specialis**: lycopersici<br>

### Eumycetoma causative agents
**2.** _Chaetomium globosum_ – MSCU0004 on PDA medium (**Figure 2**). <br>
_Chaetomium globosum_ is a filamentous fungus commonly found in soil, decaying organic matter, and plant debris. It is known for its saprophytic lifestyle and ability to degrade cellulose, making it a significant organism in natural decomposition processes. However, it can act as an opportunistic pathogen, causing infections in humans and plants under certain conditions.

#### Characteristics
**Morphology**: Produces fluffy, cottony colonies that are initially white, turning to grayish-green or olive with maturity. Its surface texture is typically velvety or powdery.<br>
**On PDA**: Colonies grow rapidly, displaying a greenish to brownish pigment as they age. The reverse of the agar may exhibit a yellowish to brown coloration.<br>
**Spore Production**: Forms lemon-shaped (elliptical) ascospores with dark, rough walls inside spherical perithecia (fruiting bodies).<br>
**Growth Conditions**: Optimal growth occurs between 25–30°C, though it can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.

#### Classification
**Kingdom**: Fungi<br>
**Phylum**: Ascomycota<br>
**Class**: Sordariomycetes<br>
**Order**: Sordariales<br>
**Family**: Chaetomiaceae<br>
**Genus**: _Chaetomium_<br>
**Species**: _Chaetomium globosum_<br>

### Mucorales
**3.** _Mucor rouxii_(+) – MSCU0009 on PDA medium (**Figure 3**). <br>
_Mucor rouxii_ is a filamentous fungus belonging to the Mucorales order, commonly found in soil and decaying organic matter. It is known for its dimorphic nature, exhibiting both filamentous and yeast-like growth forms depending on environmental conditions. While primarily saprophytic, _Mucor rouxii_ can act as an opportunistic pathogen, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, causing infections such as mucormycosis.

#### Characteristics
**Morphology**: On solid media, Mucor rouxii forms fast-growing, cottony colonies that are initially white and may turn grayish or brownish with age. In liquid media or anaerobic conditions, it can display yeast-like growth.<br>
**On PDA**: Produces dense, fluffy colonies that grow rapidly, typically filling the plate within a few days under optimal conditions (25–30°C).<br>
**Spore Production**: Produces sporangia containing sporangiospores, which are smooth-walled and spherical to ellipsoidal. Sporangia are borne on long sporangiophores with a characteristic columella at the base.<br>
**Growth Conditions**: Prefers temperatures between 25–30°C and thrives in nutrient-rich environments.

#### Classification
**Kingdom**: Fungi<br>
**Phylum**: Zygomycota<br>
**Class**: Zygomycetes<br>
**Order**: Mucorales<br>
**Family**: Mucoraceae<br>
**Genus**: _Mucor_<br>
**Species**: _Mucor rouxii_<br>

**4.** _Rhizopus_ sp. – MSCU0015 on PDA medium (**Figure 4**). <br>
_Rhizopus_ species are filamentous fungi belonging to the Mucorales order, widely distributed in soil, decaying organic material, and various foods. These fungi are known for their saprophytic lifestyle and rapid growth, making them significant decomposers. However, some species, such as _Rhizopus oryzae_ and _Rhizopus arrhizus_, are opportunistic pathogens, causing mucormycosis in immunocompromised individuals.

#### Characteristics
**Morphology**: Rapidly growing colonies with a cottony or fluffy texture, typically white at first, turning grayish to black as sporangia mature. The reverse of the plate may show a pale to dark coloration, depending on the medium.<br>
**On PDA**: Forms dense, fast-spreading colonies that can cover the plate within 24–48 hours under optimal conditions.<br>
**Spore Production**: Produces sporangia at the tips of sporangiophores, which are long, unbranched, and terminate in round, dark sporangia containing sporangiospores. Rhizoids (root-like structures) are present at the base of the sporangiophores, a distinguishing feature.<br>
**Growth Conditions**: Thrives at 25–37°C, with rapid growth in high humidity and nutrient-rich environments.

#### Classification
**Kingdom**: Fungi<br>
**Phylum**: Zygomycota<br>
**Class**: Zygomycetes<br>
**Order**: Mucorales<br>
**Family**: Mucoraceae<br>
**Genus**: _Rhizopus_<br>
<br>
**Pathogenicity**: Causes mucormycosis, particularly rhinocerebral, pulmonary, and cutaneous infections, primarily in individuals with diabetes, neutropenia, or trauma.
