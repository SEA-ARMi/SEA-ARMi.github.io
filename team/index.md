# Meet Our Southeast-Asian Collaborator

Our consortium was initiated in May 2025, bringing together five collaborators from Southeast Asia â€” Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. With diverse expertise in biology, mycology, biotechnology, and bioinformatics, our team shares a common interest in fungal diversity, environmental mycology, and medical mycology.
